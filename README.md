# LED Blinking with STM32 Nucleo

This project is a basic LED-blinking setup using the STM32 Nucleo C031C6 board, simulated on Wokwi. It aims to provide a foundational example of embedded programming with STM32 microcontrollers. The LED is connected to a digital GPIO pin, and the code toggles the LED on and off at a regular interval, creating a blinking effect.

## Project Overview

- **Microcontroller**: STM32 Nucleo C031C6
- **Simulation Platform**: Wokwi
- **Functionality**: A simple program that turns the LED on and off in a continuous loop, demonstrating basic GPIO control.

## How It Works

The program is written in C and uses STM32 HAL libraries to manage the GPIO pin connected to the LED. The LED is set to blink with a specified delay, allowing users to observe how timing functions work in embedded programming.

## Objectives

- Introduce GPIO control using the STM32 HAL library.
- Demonstrate basic embedded C programming techniques.
- Provide a foundation for more complex projects with STM32 microcontrollers.
